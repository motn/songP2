# Design Document

*This is the template for your design document. The parts in italics are concise explanations of what should go in the corresponding sections and should not appear in the final document.*

## 1 Design Considerations

*The subsections below describe the issues that need to be addressed or resolved prior to or while completing the design, as well as issues that may influence the design process.*

### 1.1 Assumptions

*Describe any assumption, background, or dependencies of the software, its use, the operational environment, or significant project issues.*


Assumption and background:
- Easy-to-use Grocery List App can make shopping efficient with smart phones, and our App is applied to android devices.
- Currently we will ignore some fancy functions like sharing lists with friends or scanning barcodes to add items. Our team will focus on how to design, implement and test the App based on the requirements.


Dependencies of software and operational environment: 
- Android Studio integrated with Java JDK and Android SDK will be used to develop and test the App.


Significant issues: 
- N/A



### 1.2 Constraints

*Describe any constraints on the system that have a significant impact on the design of the system.*


- A server(might be a laptop) should be set up to provide service to users if the Database is involved.
- Our App is only applied to android devices, which means iphone/ipad users will not have access to this App.
- We will test this App on limited kinds of emulators and real android devices due to hardware constraints.
- The interface should be intuitive and easy to use for users, and the amount of functionalities on the android devices should be limited to user requirements. 


### 1.3 System Environment

*Describe the hardware and software that the system must operate in and interact with.*

(1) Hardware: The app should work on android emulators in Android Studio and real android devices as well.

(2) Software: It would be nice if the App could be compatible with all OS and browsers when running on emulators. And it must be compatible with most of Android devices from different manufactories.

## 2 Architectural Design

*The architecture provides the high-level design view of a system and provides a basis for more detailed design work. These subsections describe the top-level components of the system you are building and their relationships.*

### 2.1 Component Diagram

*This section should provide and describe a diagram that shows the various components and how they are connected. This diagram shows the logical/functional components of the system, where each component represents a cluster of related functionality. In the case of simple systems, where there is a single component, this diagram may be unnecessary; in these cases, simply state so and concisely state why.*

### 2.2 Deployment Diagram

*This section should describe how the different components will be deployed on actual hardware devices. Similar to the previous subsection, this diagram may be unnecessary for simple systems; in these cases, simply state so and concisely state why.*

## 3 Low-Level Design

*Describe the low-level design for each of the system components identified in the previous section. For each component, you should provide details in the following UML diagrams to show its internal structure.*

### 3.1 Class Diagram

*In the case of an OO design, the internal structure of a software component would typically be expressed as a UML class diagram that represents the static class structure for the component and their relationships.*

### 3.2 Other Diagrams

*<u>Optionally</u>, you can decide to describe some dynamic aspects of your system using one or more behavioral diagrams, such as sequence and state diagrams.*

## 4 User Interface Design
*For GUI-based systems, this section should provide the specific format/layout of the user interface of the system (e.g., in the form of graphical mockups).*s
